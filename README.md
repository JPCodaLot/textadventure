# 12 Rooms Text Adventure Game
Welcome to my first text adventure game. Switch to the main.py tab and then press Ctrl+R to play. You are recommended to change the font size to 9. The purpose of this game is to collect items throughout twelve rooms. The last room has an angry beast awaiting you. This game was forked from Jcoms-coding version by JPCodalot. It has been optimized for TI-nspire CX II python. Check out https://github.com/JPCodaLot/textadventure for more information. *Have fun! :)*
